# AnythingToMp3Convertor
*==> Reworked from my other converter: **<a href=https://github.com/ChrisVDB36/Mp4ToMp3Convertor>Mp4ToMp3Convertor</a>***

Convert **any media file *(non mp3)*** to **MP3** using a simple convertor made in ***WPF C# .NET Core 3.1+***<br />
On launch the converter checks if the required components are installed, these are **FFmpeg.exe** and **FFprobe.exe**<br />
If these files are not found, they will be downloaded and installed in the same location as the converter executable
<br />
<br />
Copy pasted my code to a github repo for anyone who likes to use/modify this<br />
The convertor works for almost any media file but if you think anything can be done better feel free to edit to your own favor<br />
You are always free to note me about any chances you applied yourself!
