# AnythingToMp3Convertor
==> Reworked from my other converter: <a href=https://github.com/ChrisVDB36/Mp4ToMp3Convertor>Mp4ToMp3Convertor</a>

Convert any media file (non mp3) to MP3 using a simple convertor made in WPF C# .NET Core 3.1+<br />
I already made another converter once but decide to rework it using the latest packages and frameworks<br />
Originally this was made on request by a friend, but the code is open source!<br />
Copy pasted my code to a github repo for anyone who likes to use/modify this
<br />
<br />
The convertor works but if you think anything can be done better feel free to edit to your own favor<br />
You are always free to note me about any chances you applied yourself!
<br />
<br />
Packages used:
 - <a href=https://github.com/JamesNK/Newtonsoft.Json>Newtonsoft.Json</a>
 - <a href=https://github.com/XamlAnimatedGif/WpfAnimatedGif>WpfAnimatedGif</a>
 - <a href=https://github.com/tomaszzmuda/Xabe.FFmpeg>Xabe.FFmpeg</a>

Enjoy :-)
