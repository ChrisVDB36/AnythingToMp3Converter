# AnythingToMp3Converter

Convert **any media file *(non mp3)*** to **MP3** using a simple converter made in ***WPF C# .NET Core 3.1+***<br />
On launch the converter checks if the required components are installed, these are **FFmpeg.exe** and **FFprobe.exe**<br />
If these files are not found, they will be downloaded and installed in the same location as the converter executable
<br />
<br />
Copy pasted my code to a github repo for anyone who likes to use/modify this<br />
The converter works for almost any media file but if you think anything can be done better feel free to edit to your own favor. You are always free to note me about any chances you applied yourself!
